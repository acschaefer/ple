# Polyline Maps resulting from Veeck's Method

The files in this folder contain both the polyline maps and the processing times resulting from applying Michael Veeck's method to both the real-world and the simulated datasets. The software to produce these results was kindly provided to us by Michael Veeck.

To import the polymap results into MATLAB, use the function [`log2polymap.m`](../matlab/log2polymap.m).
